# Multilingual-Based-Sentimental-Analysis
# This project presents a comparative analysis of automatic speech emotion recognition in Arabic and English, using the KSUEmotions corpus for Arabic and the Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts (EPST) corpus for English. It examines four emotions—neutral, sadness, happiness, and anger—through various acoustic features such as pitch, formants, and intensity. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are employed to classify emotions, with results indicating higher accuracy for Arabic speech due to longer sentence durations. The study highlights the impact of language, gender, and speech features on emotion recognition performance, suggesting future improvements with advanced classifiers and deep learning techniques.
